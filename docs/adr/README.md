# FDS Architectuur Design Desicions

ADRs are automatically published to our Log4brains architecture knowledge base:

ðŸ”— **https://marcvanandel.github.io/fds-architecture/**

Please use this link to browse them.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

To preview the knowledge base locally, run:

```bash
yarn preview
```

In preview mode, the Hot Reload feature is enabled: any change you make to a markdown file is applied live in the UI.

To create a new ADR interactively, run:

```bash
yarn log4brains adr new
```
