# FDS Architecture (to be)

This repo is a 'to be' repository of the FDS Architecture Team.
It is intended as a start and showcase of what it could be.

Some things to be expected (to come) here are:

- [Architecture Decision Records](https://icepanel.medium.com/architecture-decision-records-adrs-5c66888d8723) (ADRs) incl. proven usage and publication
- Architecture Publication based on Markdown / Respec with a publication in a static webpage (together with ADRs)
- Possible integration with GitHub (or GitLab for that matters) for issue tracking, versioning, etc.

## Development

For local development follow these steps.
